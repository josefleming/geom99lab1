    <div class="main-content">
      <p>A network of commercial routes known as the Silk Route linked Asia, Africa, and Europe. Silk, spices, and other items were transported across the regions using this crucial trading network, which lasted for centuries. Neither a physical road nor a singular path, the Silk Road does not exist. Instead, the phrase refers to a system of trade routes that were in operation for more than 1,500 years, starting with the Han dynasty of China's opening of commerce in 130 B.C.E. and ending with the Ottoman Empire's closure of trade with the West in 1453 C.E.</p>
      <p>The Silk Route was not a single road, but rather a network of trade routes that passed through deserts, mountains, and other difficult terrain. The route changed over time, as new trade routes were developed and old ones fell into disuse.The Maritime Silk Road of the 21st century is a proposed sea route that would connect China's east coast with Europe, India, Africa, and the Pacific through the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean, along with the development of port and coastal infrastructure projects.</p>
